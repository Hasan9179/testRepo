#Purpose of the repo

Not all of us have worked with GIT before, so to get us all off to a good start on the project, I created this test repo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
#Your task 

Please add your name to the document "name.txt" by first forking the repo, create a new branch, then adding your name to the document, and then send a pull request.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (Jonas)! 

I can recommend the video to you if you have never worked with it before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk
